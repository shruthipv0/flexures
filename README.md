# Beam Rotation Sensor Noise Analysis

This project investigates noise sources impacting a beam rotation sensor, focusing on seismic and thermal noise below 100 Hz. The goal is to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio by optimizing key sensor parameters.

## Abstract

This study delves into noise analysis and reduction in a beam rotation sensor. Seismic and thermal noise below 100 Hz are major concerns. We optimise the center of mass, flexure stiffness, and quality factor to improve the sensor's performance. The sensor efficiently detects platform rotation and acceleration coupling. Below its resonant frequency, the measured output lags input rotation by a factor of 10^-1.

Seismic noise analysis, considering a seismic activity dataset, reveals levels ranging from 10^-14 rad/√Hz in calm conditions to 10^-13 rad/√Hz in wind. Thermal noise is calculated at 10^-19 rad/√Hz. Lower center of mass offsets reduce seismic noise, while higher quality factors and lower flexure stiffness decrease thermal noise.
